# Schema Validation

**Authors:  *Jubin Jose*, *Nibin Peter***



A schema in Aquila DB is a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) object as defined [here](https://github.com/Aquila-Network/specs/blob/main/adb/Schema.md). Every document is [validated](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation/) on insert for its compliance with schema definition.
